- User notifications
- User groups
- User chat

### How to run
1. Clone the repository `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Go to the project directory `cd [project-name]`

#### Backend
1. Go to the backend directory `cd backend`
2. Run the main script to add dependencies `bash main.sh`
3. Run the server `bash run.sh`
4. The server will be running on `http://localhost:${PORT}`

#### Frontend
1. Go to the frontend directory `cd frontend`
2. Run the server `ng serve` or `npm start`
